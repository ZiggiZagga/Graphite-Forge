title: "Add Authentication and Authorization to Edge Gateway"
labels: [security, enhancement, gateway]
---

## Problem
The Edge Gateway currently exposes all routes without any authentication or authorization. This is a security risk, especially in production environments.

## Solution
- Integrate Spring Security into the Edge Gateway.
- Implement JWT or OAuth2-based authentication for all routes.
- Restrict access to sensitive endpoints based on user roles or claims.
- Provide documentation/examples for securing new routes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All routes require authentication by default.
- Unauthorized requests are rejected with appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Security configuration is documented in the codebase.
