title: "Add Global Error Handling to Edge Gateway"
labels: [bug, enhancement, gateway]
---

## Problem
The Edge Gateway does not define custom error handling or fallback routes. Gateway errors may leak internal details or result in poor client experience.

## Solution
- Implement a global error handler for the gateway.
- Add fallback routes or default responses for common errors (e.g., service unavailable).
- Ensure error responses are user-friendly and do not expose internal information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Gateway returns clear, safe error messages for all failure scenarios.
- Fallbacks are in place for service outages.
- Error handling logic is documented.
